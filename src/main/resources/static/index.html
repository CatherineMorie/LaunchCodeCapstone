  <h1>Job Tracker</h1>
  <p>This application will allow users to add jobs applied for and track the status throughout the application and
      interview process. User will be able to search and view jobs by Company Name, Job Req Number or Job Status to
      start.
  </p>
  <p>Stretch goal: Add login page to allow for different users to access platform and only show jobs added by the
      validated user. Reformat for mobile use.
  </p>
  <br>
  <div>Jobs will consist of the following information:</div>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Company Name:</strong> Input</li>
      <li><strong>Job Req Number:</strong> Input</li>
      <li><strong>Position Title:</strong> Input</li>
      <li><strong>Salary:</strong> Drop-down List</li>
      <li><strong>Position Details:</strong> Text Area</li>
      <li><strong>Date Applied:</strong> Date Control</li>
      <li>How Applied: Input with Dropdown</li>
      <li><strong>Job Status:</strong> Radio Buttons - Applied, Interview, Offer Accepted, Declined, No Longer in
          Consideration</li>
      <li><strong>User notes:</strong> Text Area</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
  <p>Reason for Creation:<br>
      There are numerous applications that allow users to search for and apply to positions including Indeed,
      CareerBuilder and LinkedIn. None of these allow the user to manage applications outside of their platform.<br>
      This allows users to track all known information in one place as well as keep their own notes and thoughts on a
      specific position in one place.<br>
      - Speak with the hiring manager and really love their personality?<br>
      - Get a dismissive brushoff from the Tech Leads or HR that makes you second guess moving forward?<br>
      These are all things you can note for comparing opportunities as you move through the process.
